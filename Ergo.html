    King sold his first professional short story, "The Glass Floor", to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.
    After graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, 
    unable to find a teaching post immediately, he supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories 
    to men's magazines such as Cavalier. Many of these early stories were republished in the collection Night Shift. 
    The short story "The Raft" was published in Adam, a men's magazine. After being arrested for stealing traffic cones 
    (he was annoyed after one of the cones knocked his muffler loose), he was fined $250 for petty larceny but had no money to pay. 
    However, a check then arrived for "The Raft" (then titled "The Float"), and King cashed it to pay the fine. 
    In 1971, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories 
    to magazines and worked on ideas for novels. During 1966â€“1970, he wrote a draft about his dystopian novel called The Long Walk
    and the anti-war novel Sword in the Darkness, but neither of the works was published at the time; only The Long Walk 
    was later released in 1979.
