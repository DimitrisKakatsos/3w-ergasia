        In the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, 
        who pursues the "Man in Black" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth 
        and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. 
        The first of these stories, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, was initially published in five installments by 
        The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. 
        The Gunslinger was continued as an eight-book epic series called The Dark Tower, whose books King wrote and 
        published infrequently over four decades (1978-2012).
